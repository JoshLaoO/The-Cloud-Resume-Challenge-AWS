# The-Cloud-Resume-Challenge-AWS

## 05/10/2024
I've been at work trying to recreate my resume in HTML form, and I can confidently say that my Header is complete.

Also went ahead and threw in the Technical skills section of the resume, looking good so far!

4:20pm - I am back at it and I worked on the Relevant Projects portion of my front-end, soon the front end will be complete.

4:40pm - I also realized I can finish everything else on the same react component... Probably not the best practice shown, but it got the job done in a shorter amount of time.
4:45pm - I am now going to deploy as a static website on Amazon S3.
5:00pm - I realized that I have made a mistake... I tried uploading the entire folder into S3 but it looks like the upload time was 2 days so I stopped.

5:15pm - Brain fart detected... :D Needed to create a production build. And now the build is uploaded.
